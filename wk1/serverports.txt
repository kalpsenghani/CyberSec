1) What is the definition of server port?

A server port is a logical endpoint in a network communication system used by servers to listen for and accept incoming connection requests. It is identified by a unique number (known as a port number) and is associated with specific processes or services on a server. Ports help distinguish between different types of network services running on the same machine.


2)What is server port range?
The port range is the set of numbers between 0 and 65535, representing all possible port numbers that can be used for network communication.

Well-Known Ports (0–1023): Reserved for standard services and protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, etc.).
Registered Ports (1024–49151): Assigned to user-specific or application-specific services.
Dynamic/Private Ports (49152–65535): Temporary ports assigned dynamically for client-side communication.

3)How many bits does number above represent?
Each port number is represented by a 16-bit unsigned integer in the TCP/UDP protocols.

Maximum value: 2^16 - 1 = 65535
Minimum value : 0
